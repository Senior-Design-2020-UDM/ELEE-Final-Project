# ELEE-Final-Project

This project is the final exam assigned by the course, Senior Design (Winter 2020, UDM). It includes 3 main parts.

1. The first part is the gesture control (IMU control, IR and motion control) to specify which LED to be lighted and adjust the

brightness of LED. 

2. The second part is the webpage communition. In this part, we will create a webpage contained dropdown menu 

(choose which LED) and two date boxes (start and end date), once you have chosen the LED, start and end date, the webpage will

show you the energy consumption in the form of picture within this period of time. 

3. The third part is about voice control. First, we will test the speech recognition demo in Matlab, and then we will use Python

to achieve the voice control part.
